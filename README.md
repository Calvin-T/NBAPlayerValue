This project first works to classify player types as seen in github.com/acheng1230/NBA_Player_Types with some slight modifications, and then goes on to do the same for college players. Optimal line-ups will be determined in addition to line up strengths and weaknesses, and estimated values of players will be calculated dependent on the rosters of the team they’re leaving and going towards.

Attempted predictions will be made on what types of roles college players will take in the NBA using the college data as well. Various graphics will be made in attempt to make this a publishable piece at some time. Initial classification will be further modified in attempt to further deviate from acheng’s stellar work.
